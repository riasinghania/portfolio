          Iâ€™m a UC San Diego student studying International Business Management with a minor in Computer Science, passionate about using tech and strategy to solve real-world problems. From leading client-facing projects as President of Triton Consulting Group to growing engagement by 150% as a Digital Product Manager for a UCSD nonprofit, Iâ€™ve delivered impact across product, research, and consulting roles. Iâ€™ve also helped a startup expand globally through data-driven market analysis, and this summer, Iâ€™m deepening my experience as a Program Intern at Amazon.
          With a background in Java, C++, data systems, and business fundamentals like finance and accounting, Iâ€™m excited to bring a versatile, global perspective to a full-time role that blends innovation and execution.
